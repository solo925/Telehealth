Given the structure of your telehealth project, here’s the suggested order for building your apps to ensure a logical flow and functionality for your telehealth system:

### 1. **Accounts (User Authentication & Profiles)**

- Start with the `accounts` app to handle user authentication, role management (patients, doctors), and user profiles. This is crucial because users (doctors and patients) need to log in and manage their profiles before accessing other functionalities.
- **Key features**:
  - User registration (`signup.html`)
  - Login (`login.html`)
  - Profile management (`profile.html`)
  - Role management (e.g., different views for patients and doctors)

### 2. **Appointments (Booking & Scheduling)**

- After setting up user authentication, the next important feature is the ability for patients to book and manage appointments with doctors.
- **Key features**:
  - Booking an appointment (`book_appointment.html`)
  - Viewing and managing appointment lists (`appointment_list.html`)
  - Viewing appointment details (`appointment_detail.html`)

### 3. **Consultations (Video Calls & Chat)**

- Once appointments are set up, you'll need to implement the `consultations` app to manage real-time video calls and chat between doctors and patients. Integrating this with Django Channels will be critical to enable real-time functionality.
- **Key features**:
  - Video calls (`video_call.html`)
  - Chat system (`chat.html`)
  - Consultation history (`consultation_history.html`)

### 4. **Medical Records (Patient Records Management)**

- With the consultation system in place, medical records should be developed to allow doctors to manage and upload patient history and medical records. Patients should be able to view their records.
- **Key features**:
  - Viewing medical records (`record_list.html`, `record_detail.html`)
  - Uploading medical records (`upload_record.html`)

### 5. **Payments (Billing & Invoicing)**

- Finally, set up the `payments` app to handle billing for consultations and other services. This should be integrated with the appointments and consultations apps to automate payment workflows.
- **Key features**:
  - Payment page (`payment.html`)
  - Invoices for services (`invoice.html`)

### 6. **Static Files & Base Templates**

- Throughout the process, you'll be adding static assets (CSS, JS, images) and working on common layouts in `base.html`. This can be done alongside building the apps, ensuring consistency in UI/UX across the project.

By starting with user management (`accounts`), you establish the foundation for role-based access control, and then progressively build out critical functionalities like appointments, consultations, medical records, and payments.
